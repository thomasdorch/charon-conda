# charon-conda
This repository contains the files to generate a conda build for [Charon TCAD](https://charon.sandia.gov) using OpenMPI.

Install from my Anaconda channel using:
```
conda install -c thomasdorch charon
```

This is a work-in-progress and I have only tested it on my machine (Debian 12), so any feedback is greatly appreciated! Eventually, I would to add this to conda-forge as well.
